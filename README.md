RaceDelta  
Making Formula 1 data easier to explore, compare, and understand

RaceDelta is a Formula 1 data analysis and visualization platform designed for fans who want more than just standings and headlines.

Instead of only showing what happened in a race or season, RaceDelta focuses on how drivers and teams compare, where performance differences come from, and how form changes over time.

If you’ve ever asked:
- “Who actually had the better season?”
- “Was this driver faster, or just more consistent?”
- “How much does each driver contribute to a team’s results?”

RaceDelta is built to answer those questions.

## What is RaceDelta?

RaceDelta turns raw Formula 1 data into clear, visual, and comparable insights.

Most F1 websites give you tables and numbers. RaceDelta connects those numbers and tells a story:
- How drivers perform across different tracks  
- How teammates compare under the same car  
- How form evolves through a season  

The platform uses modern F1 data sources like **OpenF1** and **FastF1**, with custom logic on top to compute meaningful comparisons.
